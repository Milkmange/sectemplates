# Frequenty Asked Questions
<b>Question:</b> Do I need to have a <a href="https://www.sectemplates.com/2024/08/announcing-the-vulnerability-management-program-pack-10.html">vulnerability management program</a> in place prior to using this program pack?<br>
<b>Answer: </b> No, however, it is strongly recommended that you have some form of vulnerability management program in place, as they integrate with each other and are complementary. Additionally, it simplifies the reuse of the risk ranking system within a VM program for an exceptions program.

<b>Question:</b> Why didn't you provide .doc files for the templates and registrar?<br>
<b>Answer: </b> You should always be cautious when downloading Word documents online, as they may contain malicious scripts that could compromise your system. Most security professionals avoid downloading random Word documents, so for this reason, I've opted to publish these in a format that can be easily copied and pasted.

<b>Question:</b> Was AI used to create this content?<br>
<b>Answer: </b> No, AI was only used for spelling and grammar improvements. All content was manually created by a person.

<b>Question:</b> What software did you use to create the process diagram?<br>
<b>Answer: </b> Lucidchart was used.
