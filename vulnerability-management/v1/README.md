# Vulnerability managment Frequenty Asked Questions

<b>Question:</b> This program pack focuses on addressing issues after they are discovered. Why didn't you include vulnerability identification as part of vulnerability management?<br>
<b>Answer: </b> The technical skill sets required for vulnerability identification typically differ from those needed for managing risk in a vulnerability or risk management program. Typically, a technical program manager oversees all aspects of vulnerability risk, escalates issues, and brings in subject matter experts when necessary. In contrast, a security engineer focuses on scanning requirements, mitigation guidance, scanning types (.e.g SAST/DAST/etc), integrations, scanning configurations, scanner health, and coverage expansion. For this reason, vulnerability identification was not included in this vulnerability management program pack. However, it may be addressed in its own program pack in the future if there is sufficient demand
