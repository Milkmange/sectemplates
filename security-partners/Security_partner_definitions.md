* Directs product and engineering teams to compliance, privacy, and legal teams as needed based on risks or identified patterns.
* Assists engineering when vendor security reviews are needed, and ensures they are routed appropriately.
* Serves as a subject matter expert within security for a given product or feature.
* Assists engineering teams with security exceptions and risk acceptance, ensuring the technical accuracy of vulnerabilities and fixes while guiding stakeholders through the appropriate processes and contacts.

## Engineering Manager 
The engineering manager owns the development of products and features within the company. 

Responsibilities
* Ensures the security partner is invited to key planning meetings, strategy sessions, sprint planning, and status check-ins (e.g., MBRs).
* Acts as a point of escalation for the security partner.

## Product Manager
The product manager defines product functionality, including requirements, and prioritizes what engineering builds.

Responsibilities
* Determines product vision and strategy
* Understand customer needs and competition
* Develops Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), which engineering uses to create Technical Design Documents (TDDs) and ultimately build and ship features.
* Prioritizes engineering work based on business objectives and goals.
* Serves as the ultimate Risk Owner for the products they manage, acting as a key decision-maker for accepting risky product functionality. They are the primary stakeholder responsible for risk acceptance in a security exception or risk acceptance process.
