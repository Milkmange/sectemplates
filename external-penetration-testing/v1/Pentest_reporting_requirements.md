# Penetration testing reporting requirements 

# About
This document outlines a minimum set of information that should be included in a pentest report to support remediation efforts, and customer reporting expectations. 

# Minimum Pentest Reporting Requirements
* <b>Contact information:</b> Personnel involved in the testing, management, and support of the engagement along with associated contact emails.
* <b>Scope:</b> Clearly communicate the full scope for the engagement at the beginning of the report, and in the executive reporting. This should include domain names, product and feature versions, and any specific testing goals determined during scoping. 
* <b>Executive report:</b> Customers, auditors, and regulators may ask for pentest reports depending on the scope of the application. Generally, you want an executive report that displays the scope, list of issues, and their severity but excludes specific vulnerability details. During the scoping phase, determine if an executive report is necessary, or just include one to be safe.  
* <b>Technical details:</b> Each finding should provide full reproduction instructions to enable security and engineering to determine if the issue has been fixed.  Consider requesting reproduction steps for each issue, so these can be handed over to Quality Assurance (QA) to include in regression testing plans.
* <b>Remediation guidance/recommendations:</b> Each finding should contain a technical recommendation for how to fix the issue. This will provide guidance to both security and engineering, enabling them to develop a fix. 
* <b>Retest status:</b> It's common to have a section indicating the remediation status of each issue. Often during the engagement, issues are fixed before it ends, and it's good to capture this progress. This section is typically updated when you bring back the testers during the retesting phase once issues are believed to have been fixed correctly.
* <b>Compliance requirements:</b> If scope involves compliance testing, it may require using a certain testing methodology like OWASP Top Ten, SANS 25, or others. Coordinate with your compliance team to determine if the product, feature, or system is in scope for compliance purposes. If so, ensure the proper reporting content is included.
* <b>Vulnerability severity methodology:</b> For each vulnerability, there is going to be an associated severity level. Ensure that the methodology is either included within the report, or linked from the report to clearly indicate how a severity was determined.  

# Reviewing Results with Applicable Engineering Stakeholders
* Ensure engineering and product stakeholders are involved during scoping, and invited to the final readout to give them an opportunity to ask clarifying questions on identified issues. Give them the option to attend status meetings with the testers as well.

# Filing Security Vulnerabilities with Engineering
* Ensure issues are filed in a way that is observable within the engineering dashboards, otherwise, issues may become lost or hidden. 
* Ensure vulnerability priority aligns with internal vulnerability ranking bar to clearly indicate severity and fix expectations.
