# Sectemplates.com - Release #7: Security Partners Program Release Pack 1.0


## Security Partners Program Release Pack 1.0
I'm pleased to announce our 6th program pack, the Security Partners Program Pack. The goal of this program pack is to provide you with minimal information to establish a functioning, and impactful security partner program. This will enable you to adopt a security partnership model, and provide you with a repeatable process to scale up as needed.

A security partner program functions as a white-glove service provided by the security team, offering dedicated support to specific engineering teams. While traditional security operates as a consultancy supporting everyone, a security partner serves as a long-term, dedicated advisor to a specific organization or product line. This approach enables a security engineer to become a subject matter expert on a set of products and their technologies, foster closer collaboration with engineering, and improve communication and understanding of critical changes in product lines. The benefits of the security partnership model include:

* <b>Context</b> - The security partner is aware of past risks in a specific product, familiar with the codebase, core product functionality, and understands current security issues while also anticipating future risks.
* <b>Execution speed</b> - With historical context and familiarity with the product, security reviews such as design reviews and threat modeling can be conducted more efficiently, minimizing delays for the product and engineering teams.
* <b>Advocacy</b> - The security partner understands the challenges faced by the engineering team, including weak security controls in the technologies used, technological constraints, and architectural limitations inherited from shared components and services.
* <b>Trade off identification</b> - As risks are identified, solutions must be researched and proposed to address them. The partner has a comprehensive understanding of the products in their domain and can provide context-specific guidance, enabling quicker decision-making

The goal of this program pack is to provide you with minimal information to establish a functioning, and impactful security partner program. This will enable you to adopt a security partnership model, and provide you with a repeatable process to scale up as needed.
